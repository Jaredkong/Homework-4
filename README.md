# Homework-4

```
As a coding bootcamp student
I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Description 

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the ability to save and retrieve from local storage.  It also showcases ability to utilize bootstrap, and traversing the DOM.

The application is a timed quiz that keeps track of the users score, with the ability to save the score into local storage. 
When the timer runs out, the user will fail the quiz, and will have to refresh the page.
There is a highscore page that will list out scores that are saved onto local storage. On this page, there is also a "clear highscores" button which will clear local storage.


## Built with 
Bootstrap


## Future development

There is a lot of redundant code that I could improve upon.  For example, I made event listeners on every single button, with mostly the same code.
To improve upon this, usage of radio buttons would greatly reduce the amount of code.  There are also a lot of HTML elements that I had to grab.
The highscores list could also be sorted by descending order, in order to show the highest first.
